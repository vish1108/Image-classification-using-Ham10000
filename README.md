# Image-classification-using-Ham10000

## Overview

This project focuses on classifying skin cancer images using the HAM10000 dataset. The primary tasks include data loading, model development, and evaluation.

## Dataset

The HAM10000 dataset contains images of pigmented lesions, categorized into different skin cancer types. Ensure you have the dataset downloaded and properly organized before running the code.

## Project Structure

- **data_loader.py**: Script for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
  
- **model.py**: Implementation of the skin cancer classification model, based on the CIFAR-10 architecture.

- **train.py**: Training script for the model using the loaded dataset.

- **evaluate.py**: Script for evaluating the trained model on test data.

## Notes

- Ensure your machine has sufficient resources for model training, especially if using a large dataset.

- Experiment with hyperparameters in `model.py` and training configurations in `train.py` for optimal results.

- Regularly check for updates or modifications to the dataset for improved performance.

Feel free to customize the project structure and scripts based on your specific requirements. If you encounter any issues or have questions, refer to the documentation or reach out for assistance.

Happy coding!
